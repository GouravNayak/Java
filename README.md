# Java
This repository contains some of my personal java projects that solves different kinds of problem. It contains implementation of some popular DSAs which are as follows:
1. **Binary Search:** Used to find a numbefr in a sorted arary by reducing the range of search to half, and keep doing until range of search is reduced to size of 1 which is the required number.
2. <a href="https://github.com/GouravNayak/Java/blob/main/SelectionSort.java">Selection Sort</a>, Bubble Sort & Insertion Sort
3. Quicksort & MergeSort
4. Huffman coding
5. Breadth First Search
6. Depth First Search
7. Gradient Descent
8. Dijkstra's Algorithm
11. Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange
